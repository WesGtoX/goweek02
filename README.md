Author: [Wesley Mendes](https://github.com/WesGtoX)

## About the Languages ##

Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on [Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine](https://developers.google.com/v8/).

ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library which is used for building user interfaces specifically for single page applications.

React Native lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript. It uses the same design as React, letting you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components.
